MATALLOC
-------------------

Eliciting the addressing differences between
naive and efficient multi-dimensional allocations

-------------------

To build it, just type 'make'

To run the different tests, type:

$> ./2d.exe
$> ./3d.exe

To change the dimensions of the allocated matrices,
edit the ./src/{2d,3d}.c source files and
change the values of the {DIM_X,DIM_Y,DIM_Z} macros.
